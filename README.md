Final Project - Heart Disease Analysis

Purpose - Final Project dataset using Python to perform an analysis of patient heart disease data
The goal of this notebook is to read in multiple files supporting patient data results. The benefit of this dataset is it already came in a cleansed state which will allow the analysis to start.  There will be further analysis performed and as I begin to answer the questions.  There may be a potential for further cleaning beyond the intial cleaning performed by the author. Additionally, this will provide the basic command to explore the data set
